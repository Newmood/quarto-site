:::{.callout-note}
What I write about is nothing new but written thousands of times on the internet by others. But writing helps me learn, like rubber-duck debugging. I write much more locally, but sometimes I feel like sharing here. And sometimes I write just to test out frameworks - for example : interactive plotting libraries with Quarto.
